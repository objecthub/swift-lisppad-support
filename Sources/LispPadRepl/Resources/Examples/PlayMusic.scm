;;; Play music files
;;;
;;; This is a demo showcasing library `(lisppad audio)`. This library
;;; provides a simple asynchronous API to play back music (e.g. music in AAC,
;;; MP3, etc. format). The library allows for control over the volume, the
;;; pan, and playback rate. It also supports playing music in a loop.
;;; 
;;; Procedure `mix-music` plays two music tracks in a row using fade-in and
;;; fade-out effects as well as changing the playback rate. Here is an
;;; example invocation which plays back two tracks from Bensound.com:
